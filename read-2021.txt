Ready Player Two | Ernest Cline | 5 | I stand by the fact that Ready Player One was a great stand-alone book, and did not need a sequel.<br/><br/>That being said, I couldn't put this book down. It had the same pop culture reference charm that the first had.<br/><br/>The book started out really slow and felt like a huge PSA about how technology is dangerous and that we are destroying our planet. I did enjoy the beginning though, it's just very different than the rest of the book. Once you get through the slow part, it really picks up and never slows down until the end.<br/><br/>The whole premise felt incredibly more sci-fi to me compared to the first book. The concepts were way more out there and less believable. That being said, these concepts aren't out of the realm of possibility; it just felt a lot less likely.<br/><br/>If someone has read or is going to read Ready Player One, I would still suggest they also read this (and the short story Lacero by Andy Weir).<br/><br/>I definitely don't think another sequel would be a good idea, but it sounds like Cline has hinted that he would like to do a prequel around the creation of OASIS. I'd be all for that book. I find the characters of Halliday, Og, and Kira very interesting and I'd like to learn more about them and the early days of the OASIS.

Morning: How to make time | Allan Jenkins | 4 | I found this book charming. It probably isn't for everyone, and it's an atypical format.<br/><br/>It alternates between a month of early morning diary entries from the author, and a short interview with various people regarding mornings and their rituals.<br/><br/>At the end it provides a little bit of information on the science of sleep, but if that kind of information is what you're after, you won't find it here.<br/><br/>The diary entries are what I found most interesting. Observations and thoughts that aren't particularly profound, but enjoyable to read.<br/><br/>I've always desired to wake up earlier and have time to myself, and now it's something I want even more. I took a couple of days earlier this month and woke up early, and it was nice. I had time to read, write, think, and just be relaxed before the day begins.

The Mysterious Stranger and Other Stories | Mark Twain | 5 | The below review was originally posted on the wrong book (no 44, they mysterious stranger). I read the version from this book. It turns out this is different. It was published by the person who received all of Twain’s unfinished works after his death. <br/><br/>That person combined various drafts, removed some story, and added a whole new character (the astronomer).<br/><br/>I really enjoyed this version, as mentioned in my review, however I find the act of changing/appending/removing work done by the original author, after his death, and then publishing it to be a poor choice.<br/><br/>I am currently reading the original, unedited version (published by University of California Press, edited by William Gibson), and am enjoying it. I’ll post a new review for that one when I’m done.<br/><br/>——<br/>Original review:<br/>——<br/><br/>I think this book is fantastic. It was written by Twain just before he passed, and is considered unfinished, though it is a full story with an ending.<br/><br/>It was really dark, depicting witch trials, and various other death and destruction.<br/><br/>There are many points that serve as a rant about how terrible and pointless humanity is. It also brings into question how a god could preach love but create hell, and how he created humans and expects them to be responsible for their acts, when it should be the responsibility of the creator. In addition to that it touches on concepts that make you question all of reality.<br/><br/>This isn’t a positive book, and I found it fairly dark, but the concepts presented and thoughts provoked made it wonderful for me. The ending was particularly good. I’d highly recommend it.

The Mysterious Stranger | Mark Twain | 5 | This book was fantastic.<br/><br/>I am going to review it in comparison to the Paine version, which is most widely published. This is the actual, unaltered story written by Twain. The Paine version was taken posthumously from Twain’s earlier drafts, with the final chapter of this book slapped on the end. He wrote a new character in entirely and cut out a ton of Twain’s work.<br/><br/>I stand by my 5 star review of the Paine version, it was great as a story on its own. That being said, the characters and story line are so much more robust in this version.<br/><br/>I did prefer the character of No 44 in the Paine version to the one here, however that means I’d probably like the earlier drafts of the story, which I have not read yet.<br/><br/>My favorite part of the Paine version was the final chapter, and the same goes for this book from which it was taken.<br/><br/>It’s a fantastic story, with an even better ending, and it touches on the inadequacies and ridiculousness of human problems and how we react to them. It also makes you question all of reality.<br/><br/>If you’re going to pick a version to read, I’d suggest this one (University of California Press, edited by William Gibson). If you want to read everything possible, and get a view into the writing process of Twain, there is a book called The Mysterious Stranger Manuscripts which contains all of the versions written by Twain, including this one. I’ll be getting a copy of that and reading the earlier versions at some point.

The Boy, the Mole, the Fox and the Horse | Charlie Mackesy | 5 | This book is fantastic. I was already a fan of the author’s artwork, and I’m glad I finally got around to this book. It’s fairly short and is good for children. Every single page either has a beautiful illustration, a heart warming quote, or both. It provides a lot of advice on just being and loving, because that is enough.

Moxie | Jennifer Mathieu | 5 | This book was amazing. I couldn't put it down. It might be the fastest I've ever read a book.<br/><br/>The girls in it are badass. I found my self very proud of them, specially the final thing they did as a group.<br/><br/>The boys, and even worse, the men, in this book made me angry multiple times. Like, straight up pissed. Mostly because I know this isn't just fiction, these things happen. A lot. More than never, which is too much. It's not okay, ever.<br/><br/>The girls and everything they did were amazing. I hope we can raise our children to be as driven as them and not take shit from anyone.<br/><br/>I appreciated that there was a character that was "a good guy" who still didn't really get it, because he hasn't, and will never, live in their shoes. He will never know what it's like to be a girl surrounded by assholes who think they can do or say whatever they want. He said things such as "we're not all bad" and "do you think she's telling the truth?". It showed him learning of his own biases and lack of understanding, through this, and he came out an even better guy than he already was. Not being bad isn't enough. We also need learn and understand the best we can, and support girls and women however we can.<br/><br/>The main character struggles with all of the typical feelings of growing up being oppressed by men, feeling insecure and feeling dumb for the amazing things she's doing and thinking. She's a hero, all of the girls in the book are.<br/><br/>Aside from how amazing this story was, I also really enjoyed that all of the pages of each MOXiE zine and flyer were included in the book. I feel it added a lot to the story to see the things being talked about.<br/><br/>I'd highly recommend this to anybody. I'm looking forward to watching the Netflix movie based on it.

The Highly Sensitive Person | Elaine N. Aron | 4 | I found this book very informational and helpful.<br/><br/>I read it from the point of view of not being an HSP myself, but the spouse, and potentially parent of one. The first half was more helpful to me, as it focused on the trait itself, and what it’s like, which is what I was seeking. The rest of the book was more about living with it, and techniques you can use. This was also good to read.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend this book to anyone who thinks they may have this trait, and I think it’s good for people living with HSPs as well, to better understand them.
Before the Coffee Gets Cold | Toshikazu Kawaguchi | 4 | NONE
Walden | Henry David Thoreau | 4 | I enjoyed this book, though it took me a long time to get through. I picked it up and put it down many times. This quote from the book seems to be appropriate:<br/><br/>"Books must be read as deliberately and reservedly as they were written"<br/><br/>As I read through this, I had a lot of notes and highlights, as I typically do with non-fiction books. Like Thoreau suggests, I was reading it as deliberately as he wrote it.<br/><br/>I did find the first, and longest, chapter, Economy to be a challenge. I did not find that section as interesting as the rest of the book, and I struggled through it. If you are reading this and are really not enjoying it, I would suggest either pushing through that chapter, or skipping it and moving on to the rest to see how you feel about that.<br/><br/>Thoreau can be long winded at times, and he tends to go on tangents about society, or just describe something in nature with amazing detail. Both of which, I enjoyed.<br/><br/>I am glad I read this, and I am now a fan of Thoreau and excited to read his other works.<br/><br/>While this deviates from the book review itself, I was also playing through the video game based on it (https://www.waldengame.com/) and I find it captures the feeling of this book quite well, and have enjoyed playing through it. So if you end up reading this and are enjoying it, and like video games, I'd suggest giving that a try as well.
