The Strange Library | Haruki Murakami | 3 | This story was.. bizarre. The illustrations were interesting and the book was really short. It feels like a very odd and dark dream. I found it entertaining enough, there just wasn't a whole lot to it.

The Pentester BluePrint | Phillip L. Wylie | 4 | This was pretty good. It gives you a lot of good homework to take away from it and has some interesting history lessons. I wasn't a fan of the testimonials that took up a fair amount of the book. I get that would be interesting to some, but it's not what I was really looking for in this book. <br/><br/>I don't think this was really the book I wanted to read, but that's my own fault and not anything wrong with the book itself. It absolutely markets itself as what it is. It was a fairly quick read so I just went through it anyway, as it was interesting enough and gave some good tips.
Zen drawing - a new way to become an artist | Michelle Dujardin | 4 | NONE
Winnie-the-Pooh | A.A. Milne | 5 | I've never actually read the Pooh stories before, and I really enjoyed it. I listened to the audio book by Peter Dennis and feel the voices and sound effects/music made it even better.

each thing i show you is a piece of my death | Gemma Files | 5 | I loved this. It's my kind of story. It centers around a mysterious, deadly video file, which is something I always love. The story is presented through emails, police transcripts, news articles, etc, which is also something I enjoy. All in all this was well written and I didn't want to put it down.
Drawn to Birds | Jenny Defouw Geuder | 4 | NONE
The Once and Future Witches | Alix E. Harrow | 5 | I absolutely loved this book. The way the characters developed, and in general how well written it was. The strong sense of how history has continuously wronged women and reading along as they took back what they deserved. This was one of those books that once it started to pick up it was difficult to put down.<br/><br/>A couple of my favorite things were the spells at the top of each chapter, and the witch tales told occasionally throughout the book.<br/><br/>It was very witchy and I'd highly recommend it.
The House at Pooh Corner | A.A. Milne | 5 | This was just as good as the first one. I listened to the audio book again and love all the voices. I feel like a good quote to sum up the feeling of the book is this one:<br/><br/>“Rivers know this: there is no hurry. We shall get there some day.”<br/><br/>It’s a nice, relaxed, step back from the chaos of the modern world.
Wild Apples | Henry David Thoreau | 3 | NONE
Art Before Breakfast | Danny Gregory | 3 | NONE
A Walk in the Wood | Joseph Parent | 3 | A nice easy introduction to mindfulness. There are a lot of good quotes throughout, and the story in-between was entertaining. My only issue with it would be that a lot of the things that are said by Pooh and his friends often don't sound like something they would say. I'd say it was about half and half in that regard. It's written by someone else and I don't think matching A.A. Milne's style was the ultimate goal, but it was still pretty good.
Everyday Witchcraft | Deborah Blake | 3 | NONE
Draw Your World | Samantha Dion Baker | 5 | Samantha Dion Baker is hands down my favorite illustrator, and has had the biggest influence on my art. As always, the illustrations I'm this book are beautiful.<br/><br/>I loved her first book, Draw Your Day, and this follow-up is equally amazing. One thing this book brings to the table over the first is it has a lot more technical instructions, and challenges/prompts to attempt yourself.<br/><br/>I would highly recommend both books to anyone interested in sketch journalling.

Krampus: The Yule Lord | Brom | 5 | I thoroughly enjoyed this book. It started out pretty slow when it was primarily focusing on the main human character, but it eventually picked up and never slowed down.<br/><br/>I loved all the mythology tie-ins and It felt well thought out. It also had a lot of stratifying outcomes in the end. I don't care much for the gore depicted, and it shows the worst sides of humanity which was upsetting at times, but it all seemed appropriate for such a story.
A Kidnapped Santa Claus | L. Frank Baum | 4 | NONE
A Poem for Every Autumn Day | Allie Esiri | 2 | This was fine. There were a few really good ones, but oddly a ton of them were about war, which I wasn't a fan of. I expected more.. fall themed poems. Going to try the winter one next and see if I like it any better.
