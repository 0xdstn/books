Winnie-the-Pooh | A.A. Milne | 5 | I've never actually read the Pooh stories before, and I really enjoyed it. I listened to the audio book by Peter Dennis and feel the voices and sound effects/music made it even better.
Belonging At Work | Rhodes Perry | 5 | I really enjoyed this book. It was very informative and provided well-written definitions of various terminology. It has actionable items and sets you up with the structure needed to begin working on creating and fostering DEI at your company, regardless of your role.

No Longer Human | Osamu Dazai | 5 | I found this book fascinating, however it is incredibly dark. The themes of the book include depression, alcoholism, and suicide. It didn’t have a happy ending, and I wouldn’t have expected it to. The whole book is basically the downward spiral of a troubled individual. It was interesting to read from the point of view of someone with so many demons and such a poor view of society.
The House at Pooh Corner | A.A. Milne | 5 | This was just as good as the first one. I listened to the audio book again and love all the voices. I feel like a good quote to sum up the feeling of the book is this one:<br/><br/>“Rivers know this: there is no hurry. We shall get there some day.”<br/><br/>It’s a nice, relaxed, step back from the chaos of the modern world.
When We Were Very Young | A.A. Milne | 4 | I didn’t realize this was a book of poems, I went in expecting another set of Pooh stories. That being said, I rather enjoyed them. They are simple, yet entertaining, and occasionally humorous.
Now We Are Six | A.A. Milne | 4 | This set of poems were just as good as When We Were Very Young. I liked that Pooh made appearances in a couple of them. I’m sad that this is the end of the Pooh series, all of the stories and poems were a delight to listen to.
Wabi-Sabi Wisdom | Andrea Jacques | 3 | This book was okay. It drew me in under the assumption that it would be about wabi-sabi, however it only briefly mentioned it in the beginning. It touched on a lot of other Japanese concepts such as ikigai and the like. It did provide some good advice here and there, but a lot of it felt like a big advertisement for the author’s coaching firm. It didn’t take away from what I was reading fb enough to stop, but it was still a little off putting at times. Over all it wasn’t a bad book.
The Hogwarts Collection | J.K. Rowling | 4 | This was pretty good. Some of it was just reiterating things from the Harry Potter books, but some was new information. <br/><br/>I particularly enjoyed the first book’s backstory on McGonagall and Lupin. Both of those stories were very sad, for different reasons. I also really liked the detailed instructions on how to become an animagus. It’s insanely complex and I’m even more impressed now that Sirius, James, and Pettigrew managed to pull it off without getting themselves stuck in a half animal half human form. <br/><br/>All-in-all this was an enjoyable read, as anything Harry Potter usually is.
Digital Minimalism | Cal Newport | 5 | This book was fantastic. It provides a lot of views that highly contradict that which most of us have regarding technology and social media. Since reading it I have basically quit using social media on my phone, and just occasionally check out what's going on via a computer browser. It's refreshing to not be connected 24-7.<br/><br/>In addition to the benefits gained from the advice in the book, I ended up finding more books I want to read based on ones suggested in this book than any other one I've read. I did a lot of outside research of things mentioned in the book.<br/><br/>If you feel overwhelmed with the role technology plays in your life, or feel like you are addicted (a lot of us are), I would suggest this book. Even if you don't feel that way, it can still provide advice to make the way you use social media a lot more manageable and less exhausting.

Better Allies | Karen Catlin | 5 | This book was fantastic. I would highly recommend it. It provided a ton of actionable advice, specifically for people with a lot of privilege, to be allies for underrepresented groups.<br/><br/>Aside from the many things I learned, one of the most helpful things was a list of 50 different privileges you could have. I had 47, and it was really eye opening. Not only that, but as the author expected, a lot of the items made me think “that really happens?”<br/><br/>The book provided me with a lot of insight into the challenges others face, and gave me a lot that I can do from any position within any company.<br/><br/>I’m very glad I read this book.
Force Multiplier | Cory Doctorow | 4 | This short story was pretty good. As always with the books in the little brother series, it was very informational and provides a warning of the dangers tech and surveillance can impose on us.
The Haunting of Sunshine Girl | Paige McKenzie | 4 | I really enjoyed this book. I had no prior knowledge of the YouTube channel it is based on. I got the book from a free little library and it sounded interesting to me (amusingly, it was water damaged, and water plays a big part in the story).<br/><br/>About halfway through the book shifts to be more fantasy than just a ghost story, and I really liked where it went. I’ll be reading the next two books for sure.

A History of Magic | Pottermore Publishing | 5 | These were fantastic. I expected them to be more backstory for the lore of the wizarding world, something similar to The Hogwarts Collection (which was the backstory of characters), but I was completely wrong.<br/><br/>These books detail the real-life origins and inspirations of various creatures and topics from the Harry Potter books. I gathered a fairly large list of other books that I want to look into or read, which I've listed below.<br/><br/>Aside from that, there was also a lot of illustrations (by JK Rowling) and original version changes for the Harry Potter books also documented, which was always interesting.<br/><br/>There are a ton of quotes from the books throughout these. After the first couple of sections, I stopped reading them, as it just slowed me down and I didn't feel the excerpts provided much for me. I was a lot more interested in all the facts being presented than the relevant portions of the books for the topic at hand.<br/><br/>My favorite sections were herbology, divination, and charms.<br/><br/>Below are the books I found referenced, separated by section:<br/><br/>Charms<br/>- Liber Medicinalis (The Book of Medicine) by Quintus Serenus Sammonicus<br/>- A Discourse of Witchcraft as it was Acted in the Family of Mr Edward Farfax of Fuystone<br/>- The Wonders of the Invisible World: Being an Account of the Tryals of Several Witches, Lately Executed in New-England by Cotton Mather<br/>- The History of the Lancashire Witches<br/>- The Book of King Solomon called the Key of Knowledge<br/><br/>Defence Against the Dark Arts<br/>- Accurate Description of the Very Rich Thesaurus of the Principal and Rarest Natural Objects by by Albertus Seba<br/>- Historia Animalium by Idonius<br/>- Tonegawa Zushi - Akamatsu Sotan<br/>- The Historie of Foure-Footed Beasts by Edward Topsell<br/><br/>Potions<br/>- Ortus Sanitatis (The Garden of Health)<br/>- De Laniis et Phitonicis Mulieribu (On Witches and Female Fortune Tellers) by Ulrich Molitor<br/>- Malleus Maleficarum (The Hammer of the Witches) by Heinrich Kramer<br/>- Bald's Leechbook<br/>- The Compleat History of Druggs by Pierre Pomet<br/>- The Ripley Scroll<br/>- The Compound of Alchymy by George Ripley<br/>- Uraltes Chymisches Werck (Age-Old Chemical Work)<br/>- Splendor Solis<br/><br/>Herbology<br/>- The Herball or Generall Historie of Plantes by John Gerard<br/>- Culpeper's Herbal by Nicholas Culpeper<br/>- Herbarium - Gherardo Cibo<br/>- Hortus Eystettensis<br/>- Hortus Hyemalis by John Evelyn<br/>- A Curious Herbal by Elizabeth Blackwell<br/>- Temple of Flora by Robert John Thornton<br/>- De Materia Medica (On Medical Material) by Pedanius Dioscorides<br/>- Illustrated Herbal by Giovanni Cadamosto<br/><br/>Divination<br/>- Mother Shipton Wonders!!!
